# OceanICU

This repository holds the neural network framework developed to extrapolate/interpolate SOCAT fCO2sw observations into globally complete fields, based
on a feed forward neural network approach.
The framework has been developed to allow input parameter combinations to be modified whilst keeping the neural network and CO2 flux calculations
consistent. The framework also expands on the uncertainty determination approaches, allowing time varying uncertainties to be calculated and then
propagated through the flux calculations.
